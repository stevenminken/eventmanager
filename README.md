## Introduction

Welcome to my EventManager GitHub repository! This project is the culmination of my efforts during the Full Stack Developer (backend) program at NOVI Hogeschool. The result is a Spring Boot application designed to serve as a solid and expandable foundation for event management and ticket booking.

## Features

* Event Management: Create, edit, and delete events, artists, locations, and tickets.
* User: Search events and buy tickets.
* Statistics: Event organizers gain insights into ticket sales and revenue per event.
* Artist Documentation: Administrators can upload essential files, such as artist contracts.
* Security and Scalability: Built with security and scalability in mind to ensure a safe and solid experience.

## Getting Started and Installation
